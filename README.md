### Introduction
For generations, gold has been a significant precious metal. It is one of the significant financial assets

other markets. But the unstable rise and fall in gold rates makes it riskier and develops a fear for the investors 
to invest in the gold market. Therefore, it is important to predict gold rates carefully. Thus, this paper aims 
on examining the interconnection between certain economic market variables and the price of gold, they are 
the S&P500 index, silver price, crude oil price, and US dollar exchange value (USD). Additionally, this 
research employs five Machine learning techniques, such as. Decision Tree (DT), Random Forest, and 
compares them to get the best fit model.Investing in gold has developed over a amount of your time in 
conventional forms by buying jewelleryor through modern strategies, either by buying gold coins and bars 
(which area unit already accessible in scheduled banks).Historically, gold had been used as a sort of
